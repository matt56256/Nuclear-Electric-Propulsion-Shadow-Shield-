# Nuclear-electric propulsion shadow shield

This is a master project which is based on testing a shadow/radiation sheild for a nuclear electric vehicle.
The project will be using OpenMC to construct the model and test how the radiation produced by the reactor 
travels through the sheild and how much radaition the shield can cope with.
